# 🎬 EDA on Online Streaming Platforms

Hi everyone! 👋  
This is my first data project as part of my self-learning journey into **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and eventually **Deep Learning** and **Generative AI**.

As a first step, I focused on learning the foundations of **data analysis** using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`. This project puts that learning into action.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, I analyzed data from popular online streaming platforms — **Netflix**, **Hulu**, **Prime Video**, and **Disney+** — to uncover:

- 🎯 Which platforms have the highest-rated content
- ⭐ Top 10 IMDb titles per platform
- 🎭 Genre distributions and insights
- 📈 Visual comparisons of content volume and quality

## 🔍 What I Learned

- Cleaning and preprocessing data using `Pandas`
- Handling missing and non-numeric data
- Aggregating and grouping for comparison
- Creating bar charts and interactive sunburst visualizations
- Structuring a full data project for sharing
